[#org-management]
== Organization Management

We have created our controller, and we can now start to create objects, users, and groups on our domain.


[#ou-and-groups]
== ☑️ Organizational Units and Groups
Active Directory allows us to create organizational units which mirror our functional business groups. In this exercise we are going to create a group for our Ansible users. However, we are also going to create this group under its own OU in Active Directory.

Navigate to your `vscode` to start.

Select the `create_ou_grp.yml` playbook. Edit the playbook for the following tasks.

[source,yaml]
----
  tasks:
    - name: Create Organizational Unit
      microsoft.ad.ou:
        name: "{{ org_unit }}"
        state: present
        protect_from_deletion: true

    - name: Create a group in an OU
      microsoft.ad.group:
        name: "{{ group_name }}"
        scope: global
        path: OU="{{ org_unit }}",DC=active-directory-lab,DC=ansible
        state: present

----

The first task creates an organizational unit in the domain, while the second creates a group within that OU. We can save this playbook and push it back to our repo.

Before we update our remote repo, we need to configure our git details:

[source,sh]
----
git config --global user.email "student@redhat.com"
git config --global user.name "Student"
----

Next let's update the repo:

[source,sh]
----
git add *
git commit -m "Updating the OU Playbook"
git push
----

You will be asked to authenticate at the top of the vscode editor -

Use the following credentials:

----
Username: student
Password: learn_ansible
----

Once the repo has been updated, we can navigate to `AAP` to update the project and create a template.

In your controller, navigate to *Automation Execution* > *Projects*. You can click on the sync project button on the `Active-Directory AAP` project. 

image::sync.png[SYNC,link=self,window=_blank]

This will grab the latest version of our playbooks.

Next, navigate to *Automation Execution* > *Templates* and select *Create template* followed by *Create job template*.

Create a template with the following details:

----
Name: Create OU and Groups
Description: Creating OU and user group based on business units
Inventory: Servers
Project: Active-Directory AAP
Playbook: create_ou_grp.yml
Execution Environment: Windows_ee
Credentials: Windows Host
----

Save the template. 
Next we need to add a survey.

image::survey.png[SURVEY,link=self,window=_blank]

Select Survey on the right of the job template details page. Select *Create survey question* and create the following survey question:

----
Question: Please define your Organization Unit (OU)
Description: OU to be created on the domain
Answer variable name: org_unit
Answer Type: Text
----

Save this question and add the next:

----
Question: Please define your Group for the OU
Description: Group for the OU to be created on the domain
Answer variable name: group_name
Answer Type: Text
----

Save, and enable the survey with the toggle. 

image::enable_survey.png[ENABLE SURVEY,link=self,window=_blank]

Navigate back to templates and click on the rocket on our `Create OU and Group` template. The survey will ask you for input. Please provide the following:

----
Organizational Unit = Ansible
Group Name = DevOps
----

Once the template is done, we can verify the changes on our domain controller. Navigate to the `windows` tab. *Start* > *Server Manager*, next select *Tools* and *Active Directory Users and Computers*.

image::tools.png[TOOLS,link=self,window=_blank]

If you drop down your active-directory-lab.ansible domain, you should see your Ansible OU and the group inside it.

[#creating-domain-users]
== ☑️ Creating domain users

We have our groups and OU created, and now we can create some users. Navigate back to `vscode` and select the playbook `create_user.yml`. This playbook allows you to create users on the domain. However, these tasks add users into different groups, to control this we use `tags`.

Navigate to `AAP` and let us create a template to create admin users. Create the following template with the following details:

----
Name: Create Admin users
Inventory: Servers
Project: Active-Directory AAP
Playbook: create_user.yml
Execution Environment: Windows_ee
Credentials: Windows Host
Job Tags: admin_user
----

NOTE: When adding a Job Tag, you need to create the tag before you can allocate it.

image::admin-tag.png[ADMIN TAG,link=self,window=_blank]

We need to add a survey again, so once this template is saved, navigate to Surveys and let's add the following three questions:

----
Question: Please define your user Identity (username)
Description: Identity (user login name)
Answer variable name: user_identity
Answer Type: Text

Question: Please define your password
Description: User Password
Answer variable name: user_password
Answer Type: Password

Question: Please define your OU path
Description: Account to be associated to the OU
Answer variable name: ou_path
Answer Type: Text
Default Answer: CN=Users,DC=active-directory-lab,DC=ansible
----

Save, and don't forget to enable all of the surveys!

Next, let's create a job template specifically for the Ansible group we created. Navigate back to *Automation Execution* > *Templates*. Select `copy template` to copy our *Create Admin users* template. Let's edit the copy with the following:

----
Name: Create Ansible users
Inventory: Servers
Project: Active-Directory AAP
Playbook: create_user.yml
Execution Environment: Windows_ee
Credentials: Windows Host
Job Tags: ansible_user
----

Save the template.

Great work so far!

Navigate back to *Automation Execution* > *Templates* and launch the `Create Admin users` template. Provide the following details:

----
Username: zerocool
Password: P@ssw0rd.123
Desired OU: CN=Users,DC=active-directory-lab,DC=ansible
----

Once successful, let us navigate to our Windows tab and verify the user has been created and is a member of the right groups.

image::zero.png[ZERO COOL,link=self,window=_blank]

Navigate back to AAP, *Automation Execution* > *Templates* and launch the Create Ansible user template. Provide the following details:

----
Username: acidburn
Password: P@ssw0rd.123
Desired OU: OU=Ansible,DC=active-directory-lab,DC=ansible
----

Again, once complete, verify on our Windows system.

[#creating-multiple-users]
== ☑️ Creating multiple users

Before moving to the last exercise, let's create a few extra users.
Navigate to `vscode` and select the playbook `lab_users.yml`. This playbook defines two variables: one for the OU we want to use (OU=Ansible,DC=active-directory-lab,DC=ansible) and the other for the user password, which we will generate at random.

If you have previously completed the 'Getting started with Windows automation' lab, you would have done a similar exercise to create local accounts. This time we are using the Active Directory modules to create these users.

We have defined users as a `dictionary`, and we can then loop through those details to provide Active Directory with more account information. We can finish the playbook by adding a task to create users in a loop.

[source,yaml]
----
    - name: Create users for lab
      microsoft.ad.user:
        identity: "{{ item.key }}"
        password: "{{ user_password }}"
        firstname: "{{ item.value.firstname }}"
        surname: "{{ item.value.surname }}"
        name: "{{ item.value.firstname }} {{ item.value.surname }}"
        state: present
        path: "{{ ou_path }}"
        groups:
          set:
            - Domain Users
      loop: "{{ users_list | dict2items }}"
----

Save the playbook and let's push it to our repo again.

[source,sh]
----
git add *
git commit -m "Updating the Lab Users"
git push
----

Remember the git username and password:

----
Username: student
Password: learn_ansible
----

Once we have saved this, we can navigate to `AAP`. We need to synchronize our project. 
Navigate to *Automation Execution* > *Projects* and resync. Then let's create a new template with the following details:

----
Name: Create Ansible Lab users
Inventory: Servers
Project: Active-Directory AAP
Playbook: lab_users.yml
Execution Environment: Windows_ee
Credentials: Windows Host
----

Once created, save the template and launch it!

We can verify our changes in Active Directory.

Confirm the details are correct.
