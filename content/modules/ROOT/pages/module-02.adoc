== Organization Management

We have created our controller, and we can now start to create objects users and groups on our domain.


== ☑️ Organizational Units and Groups
Active Directory allows us to create organizational units which mirror our functional buisness groups. In this exercise we are going to create a group for our Ansible users. However we are also going to create this group under its own OU in the Active Directory.

Navigate to your `vscode` to start.

Select the `create_ou_grp.yml` playbook. Edit the playbook for the following tasks.

[,yaml]
----
  tasks:
    - name: Create Organizational Unit
      microsoft.ad.ou:
        name: "{{ org_unit }}"
        state: present
        protect_from_deletion: true

    - name: Create a group in an OU
      microsoft.ad.group:
        name: "{{ group_name }}"
        scope: global
        path: OU="{{ org_unit }}",DC=instruqt,DC=ansible
        state: present

----

The first task creates an organizational unit in the domain, while the secound creates a group within that OU. We can save this playbook and push it back to our repo.

Before we update our remote repo, we need to configure our git details:

[,text]
----
git config --global user.email "student@redhat.com"
git config --global user.name "Student"
----

Next lets update the repo:

[,text]
----
git add *
git commit -m "Updating the OU Playbook"
git push
----

You will be asked to authenticate at the top of the vscode editor -

Use the following credentials:

[,text]
----
Username: student
Password: learn_ansible
----

Once the repo has been updated, we can navigate to `AAP` to update the project and create a template.

In your controller, navigate to *Automation Execution* > *Projects*. You can click on the sync project botton on the `Active-Directory AAP` project. 

image::sync.png[SYNC,link=self,window=_blank]

This will grab the latest version of our playbooks.

Next, navigate to *Automation Execution* > *Templates* and select *Create template* followed by *Create job template*.

Create a template with the following details:

[,text]
----
Name: Create OU and Groups
Description: Creating OU and User group based on Buisness Units
Inventory: Servers
Project: Active-Directory AAP
Playbook: create_ou_grp.yml
Execution Environment: Windows_ee
Credentials: Windows Host
----

Save the template. 
Next we need to add a survey.

image::survey.png[SURVEY,link=self,window=_blank]

Select Survey on the right of the job template details page. Select *Create survey question* and create the following survey question:

[,text]
----
Question: Please define your Organization Unit (OU)
Description: OU to be created on the domain
Answer variable name: org_unit
Answer Type: Text
----

Save this question and add the next:

[,text]
----
Question: Please define your Group for the OU
Description: Group for the OU to be created on the domain
Answer variable name: group_name
Answer Type: Text
----

Save, and enable the survey with the toggle. 

image::enable_survey.png[ENABLE SURVEY,link=self,window=_blank]

Navigate back to templates and click on the rocket on our `Create OU and Group` template. The survey will ask you for input, please provide the following:

[,text]
----
Organizational Unit = Ansible
Group Name = DevOps
----

Once the template is done, we can verify the changes on our domain controller. Navigate to the `windows` tab. *Start* > *Server Manager*, next select *tools* and *Active Directory Users and Computers*.

image::tools.png[TOOL,link=self,window=_blank]

If you drop down your instruqt.ansible domain, you should see your Ansible OU and the group inside it.

== ☑️ Creating domain users

We have our groups and OU created, we can create some users. Navigate back to you `vscode` and select the playbook `create_user.yml`. This playbook allows you to create users on the domain. However, these tasks add users into different groups, to control this we use `tags`.

Navigate to `controller` and let us create a template to create admin users. Create the following template with the following details:

[,text]
----
    Name: Create Admin users
    Inventory: Servers
    Project: Active-Directory AAP
    Execution Environement: Windows_ee
    Playbook: create_user.yml
    Credentials: Windows Host
    Job Tags: admin_user
----

!!Note: When adding a Job Tag, you need to create the tag before you can allocate it.

We need to add a survey again, so once this template is saved, navigate to Surveys and lets add the following three questions:

[,text]
----
    Question: Please define your user Identity (username)
    Description: Identity (user login name)
    Answer variable name: user_identity
    Answer Type: Text

    Question: Please define your password
    Description: User Password
    Answer variable name: user_password
    Answer Type: password

    Question: Please define your OU path
    Description: Account to be associated to the OU
    Answer variable name: ou_path
    Answer Type: Text
    Default Answer: CN=Users,DC=instruqt,DC=ansible
----

Save, and dont forget to enable the Survey!

Next, lets create a job template specifically for the Ansible group we created. Navigate back to *Automation Execution* > *Templates*. Select `copy template` to copy our *Create Admin users* template. Let's edit the copy with the following:

[,text]
----
    Name: Create Ansible users
    Inventory: Servers
    Project: Active-Directory AAP
    Execution Environement: Windows_ee
    Playbook: create_user.yml
    Credentials: Windows Host
    Job Tags: ansible_user
----

Save the template.

Great work so far!

Navigate back to *Automation Execution* > *Templates* and launch the `Create Admin users` template. Provide the following details:

[,text]
----
    Username: zerocool
    Password: P@ssw0rd.123
    Desired OU: CN=Users,DC=instruqt,DC=ansible
----

Once succesful, let us navigate to our windows tab and verify the user has been created and is a member of the right groups.

image::zero.png[ZeroCool,link=self,window=_blank]

Navigate back to controller, *Automation Execution* > *Templates* and launch the Create Ansible user template. Provide the following details:

[,text]
----
    Username: acidburn
    Password: P@ssw0rd.123
    Desired OU: OU=Ansible,DC=instruqt,DC=ansible
----

Again, once complete verify on our Windows system.

== ☑️ Creating multiple users

Before moving to the last exercise, lets create a few extra users.
Navigate to `vscode` and select the playbook `lab_users.yml`. This playbook defines to variables, one for the OU we want to use (OU=Ansible,DC=instruqt,DC=ansible) and the other is the user password which we will generate at random.

If you have previously completed the Getting started with Windows automation lab, you would have done a similar exercise to create local accounts. This time we are using the Active Directory modules to create these users.

We have defined users as a `dictionary` and we can then loop through those details to provide the AD more account information.  We can finish the playbook by adding a task to create users in a loop.

[,yaml]
----
      - name: Create users for lab
        microsoft.ad.user:
         identity: "{{  item.key  }}"
         password: "{{  user_password  }}"
         firstname: "{{  item.value.firstname  }}"
         surname: "{{  item.value.surname  }}"
         state: present
         path: "{{  ou_path  }}"
         groups:
          set:
           - Domain Users
        loop: "{{  users_list | dict2items  }}"
----

Save the playbook and lets push it to our repo again.

[,text]
----
    git add *
    git commit -m "Updating the Lab Users"
    git push
----

Remember the git username and password:

[,text]
----
    Username: student
    Password: learn_ansible
----

Once we have saved this we can navigate to controller, we need to synchronise our project. Navigate to  *Automation Execution* > *Projects* and resync. Then lets create a new template with the following details:

[,text]
----
    Name: Create Ansible Lab users
    Inventory: Servers
    Project: Active-Directory AAP
    Execution Environement: Windows_ee
    Playbook: lab_users.yml
    Credentials: Windows Host
----

Once created save the template and launch it!

We can verify our changes on our Active Directory

Confirm the details are correct
